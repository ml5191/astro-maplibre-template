  description: The diamondback terrapin, a keystone species in wetlands, is the only turtle in Jamaica Bay adapted to brackish water, thriving in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Yet human developments—such as bulkheads, railways, airports, and other hardened shorelines—form barriers that restrict terrapins’ essential movement between water, where they feed and mate, and land, where they nest and reproduce.

  description: Human constructions and developments—such as bulkhead houses, railroads, airports, and other hard shorelines and surfaces—form barriers that prevent terrapins from moving between water and land. This poses a significant challenge, as land is essential for their nesting and reproduction.
