  description: Diamondback terrapins inhabit both water and land. They feed in salt marshes and mate in shallow waters. Every year, during late spring and early summer, female terrapins in Jamaica Bay come ashore to find sandy ground for nesting, This map illustrates Jamaica Bay's land use from the terrapin's perspective, highlighting the critical areas essential to their life cycle.

  description: However, human constructions and hardened shorelines, such as bulkhead houses, ripraps, and airports, create barriers that prevent terrapins from moving between water and land. This is significant because land is essential for their nesting and reproduction.

  description: JFK Airport has long been a significant nesting site for diamondback terrapins. Constructed on sandy grounds created by transported fill, the airport inadvertently provides ideal nesting conditions. However, this has led to frequent terrapin incursions onto the runways in search of nesting sites. These incidents not only disrupt air traffic but also pose significant risks to the terrapinsâ€™ safety.

  description: Along Cross Bay Boulevard, residential properties have replaced natural shoreline transitions with bulkheads. These vertical barriers, designed to protect homes, have eliminated the gradual slopes that once facilitated a seamless connection between land and water. As a result, terrapins face significant challenges accessing the shore.
